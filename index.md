## Privilege Walk Project Description
The Privilege Walk exercise demonstrates how your specific collection of characteristics, aspects, and events in your life can accelerate or hinder your progress and achievments in life, relative to other people with a different collection of those charactersitics, aspects, and events.  It is intended to initiate and facilitate a meaningful dialog on impacts of privilege, diversity, and inclusion among various groups of people.

Here are links to two descriptions of the Privilege Walk exercise:

  - [EIU Privilege Walk Exercise](https://www.eiu.edu/eiu1111/Privilege%20Walk%20Exercise-%20Transfer%20Leadership%20Institute-%20Week%204.pdf)

You will be creating an application that will automate and facilitate the Privilege Walk exercise, allowing for individuals and groups to participate in a synchronous, asynchronous, and/or anonymous fashion.  Here are links to two descriptions and instructions fo the Privilege Walk exeercise.

As your clients, Drs. Druen and Shedlosky will be providing you with all Requirements for the project, and will also establish the task priorities for your agile development process, in consultation me, and in coordination with the Privilege Walk development team.  They will also be attending your status meetings, and assignment and Milestone presentations.
